nalyzing the Errors
1. Primary Error: MODULE_NOT_FOUND for /app/bootstrap.js
Error Details:
The container failed to start because it tried to run node bootstrap.js (as specified in the Cloud Run configuration: command: ["node"], args: ["bootstrap.js"]), but /app/bootstrap.js was not found.
Exit code 1 indicates a runtime error, and the Default STARTUP TCP probe failed confirms the application didn’t bind to port 8080.
Cause:
The cloudbuild.yaml or Cloud Run configuration incorrectly specifies bootstrap.js as the entrypoint. Your project (rest-express) uses a TypeScript setup with server/index.ts, compiled to dist/index.js via esbuild, and executed with npm start (NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js).
The Dockerfile used by Cloud Build likely does not align with your project’s entrypoint, or the cloudbuild.yaml overrides the Dockerfile’s CMD with node bootstrap.js.
The bootstrap.js file does not exist in your repository, as your project structure (based on previous interactions) includes server/index.ts, vite.ts, and routes/index.ts, with no mention of bootstrap.js.
Impact:
The container crashes immediately, failing to start the Express server and bind to port 8080, causing the deployment to fail.
2. Build Step Failure
Error Details:
ERROR: build step 2 "gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk" failed: step exited with non-zero status: 1
ERROR: (gcloud.builds.submit) build 14e0ff80-d8f1-4c17-9116-f9b3be03ec67 completed with status "FAILURE"
Cause:
The failure occurred in the deployment step (step 2, using gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk), which executes gcloud run deploy. The container’s runtime error (MODULE_NOT_FOUND) caused this step to exit with a non-zero status.
Impact:
The build process completed the image build and push but failed during deployment due to the container startup issue.
3. IAM Policy Success
Details:
The logs show:
text

Copy
Setting IAM policy for public access...
Updated IAM policy for service [greenlane-crm-app].
bindings:
- members:
  - allUsers
  role: roles/run.invoker
This confirms that the IAM policy was successfully updated to allow unauthenticated access, resolving the earlier IAM-related warning.
Cause:
The gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding command was executed successfully, as Replit recommended.
Impact:
The IAM issue is no longer a barrier to deployment.
4. Additional Observations
Service Name Inconsistency:
The service name is greenlane-crm-app, which differs from your earlier commands (greenlane-app). This suggests either a misconfiguration in cloudbuild.yaml or a separate service created by Replit’s setup.
You previously confirmed using greenlane-app, so we need to align the service name.
Missing Application Logs:
The logs lack detailed application errors beyond MODULE_NOT_FOUND, indicating the crash occurred early in the container startup, before the Express server could initialize or log additional details.
Environment Variables:
The deployment sets NODE_ENV=production and BASE_DOMAIN=greenlanecloudsolutions.com but omits CRM_DOMAIN and API_DOMAIN, which are critical for your domain-based routing logic in server/index.ts.
Context:
Project: rest-express uses TypeScript (server/index.ts), compiled to dist/index.js via esbuild, with npm start as the entrypoint.
