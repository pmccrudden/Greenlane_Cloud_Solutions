Project: Eye-Catching Marketing Website for Greenlane Cloud Solutions with Free Trial and Dynamic Pricing

Objective: Revamp the marketing website for Greenlane Cloud Solutions (hosted at greenlanecloudsolutions.com) to be more eye-catching, modern, and optimized for maximizing sales and lead conversions. The site should guide users to sign up for a 14-day free trial via Stripe, requiring card details upfront, with automatic charging if not canceled before the trial ends. The product packaging should include the core CRM priced by usage (number of users), with add-ons (Community, Marketing Hub, Support Centre) as optional extras. Pricing must dynamically adjust based on the user’s location (Europe, Australia, USA, Canada, UK). The website should feature professional-looking screenshots of the product with short titles or briefs explaining the benefit of each feature or platform.

Requirements:

1. **Tech Stack**:
   - Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI (consistent with the existing green/white color scheme).
   - Backend: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests, Stripe integration, and location-based pricing.
   - External APIs: Stripe for payment processing, IP geolocation API (e.g., ipapi.co) for detecting user location.
   - Hosting: Designed for deployment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku) with CDN support for fast loading.

2. **Design and User Experience**:
   - **Eye-Catching and Modern**:
     - Use bold typography, vibrant gradients (e.g., green to white transitions), and animated elements (e.g., subtle hover effects, scrolling animations) to make the site visually engaging [Ref web ID: 18].
     - Incorporate rich media like animated banners or hero images to capture attention [Ref web ID: 18].
     - Ensure a mobile-optimized, responsive design with a consistent brand experience across devices [Ref web ID: 21].
   - **Conversion-Driven Flow**:
     - Place a prominent “Start Your 14-Day Free Trial” CTA button in the hero section, sticky header, and key sections (e.g., pricing, features) [Ref web ID: 21].
     - Use urgency cues like “No credit card required” (even though Stripe requires card details, clarify it’s not charged until after the trial) and “Limited Offer” to drive action [Ref web ID: 0].
     - Add trust signals: security badges (e.g., “Secured by Stripe”), testimonials, and client logos [Ref web ID: 23].
   - **Navigation**:
     - Sticky header with links: Home, Features, Pricing, Screenshots, Sign Up, Log In.

3. **Free Trial Signup with Stripe**:
   - **Flow**:
     1. User clicks “Start Your 14-Day Free Trial” button.
     2. Redirect to a signup form: fields for Name, Email, Company Name, and Password.
     3. After submitting, redirect to a Stripe Checkout form requiring card details for a 14-day free trial.
     4. Post-signup, create a tenant (e.g., company1.greenlanecloudsolutions.com) and email the user with access details.
   - **Stripe Integration**:
     - Use Stripe Checkout to handle the trial signup with a $0 initial charge [Ref web ID: 7].
     - Set a 14-day trial period, after which the user is automatically charged the selected plan unless canceled [Ref web ID: 7].
     - Provide a “Cancel Subscription” option in the user’s account dashboard to stop charges before the trial ends.
     - Display a confirmation message: “Your 14-day free trial has started! You’ll be charged on [date] unless canceled.”
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Validate form inputs (e.g., email format) and show error messages (e.g., “Invalid email”).
     - Handle Stripe errors (e.g., declined card) with user-friendly messages.
