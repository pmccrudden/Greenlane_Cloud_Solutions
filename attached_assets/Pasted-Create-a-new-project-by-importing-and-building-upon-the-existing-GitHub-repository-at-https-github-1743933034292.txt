Create a new project by importing and building upon the existing GitHub repository at https://github.com/pmccrudden/GreenLane_ai3.git. This is a CRM system called GreenLane Cloud Solutions, and I want to enhance it with the following features and requirements, using the existing codebase as a foundation where applicable. The project should be developed and deployed on Replit, targeting Google Cloud Run for deployment, with Cloudflare for wildcard DNS functionality to support subdomains. Below are the detailed specifications:

CRM with Multi-Tenant Isolation: Build a multi-tenant CRM where each tenant is isolated and accessed via a unique subdomain (e.g., facebook.greenlanecloudsolutions.com) under the main domain https://greenlanecloudsolutions.com. The CRM should support easy creation and management of Accounts, Deals, Projects, and Contacts. Include hierarchical account structures with parent accounts and multiple levels of parent-of-parent accounts (e.g., for hotels under geographic or brand hierarchies). Ensure tenant data is fully isolated between subdomains.
Sales/Marketing Website: Develop a public-facing website at https://greenlanecloudsolutions.com with options for 'Sign Up / Start Free Trial' and 'Sign In'. For sign-up, collect user details and payment information via Stripe integration. Upon successful payment confirmation, send an email to the customer with their tenant details (e.g., subdomain like companyname.greenlanecloudsolutions.com) and admin credentials. The 'Sign In' option should lead to an /auth page where users enter their tenant/company name, email, and password to log into their tenant. If accessing directly via their subdomain (e.g., companyname.greenlanecloudsolutions.com), the login page should omit the tenant name field and show only email/password and SSO options.
Support Ticket System: Implement a robust support ticket system that accepts tickets from multiple sources: email submissions, manual creation by support staff (e.g., during phone calls), and other channels like Slack (or suggest additional useful integrations). Each ticket should display its source, full history, and activity log. Allow staff to add responses, which are then sent to the customer via email or Slack based on the ticket’s origin. Include functionality for custom queues and reports to route tickets to teams like Tier 1 Support, Tier 2 Support, Customer Success, Implementation, SecOps, or RevOps.
AI Analytics: Extend the existing AI capabilities from the GitHub repo. Add AI-driven account management and Health Scorecards to calculate health scores for each Account, Project, and Deal. Summarize these in an 'AI Analytics' section, styled similarly to the existing Lead Scoring, Sales Insights, and Performance Prediction features, providing a comprehensive overview of tenant performance.
Digital Journey: Replace the current 'Email Campaigns' section with a 'Digital Journey' module. This should include:
A Communication Planner where customers can map custom journeys (e.g., an onboarding sequence: send a Welcome Email on signup, then a follow-up email X days later, configurable by the customer).
An Email Templates section with industry-standard drag-and-drop functionality for creating HTML-rich email templates. These templates can be used in the Communication Planner or sent manually by account managers or onboarding staff from within an Account.
Deployment Requirements: Set up the project for deployment to Google Cloud Run, leveraging Replit’s deployment tools. Use Cloudflare for wildcard DNS to enable dynamic subdomain creation (e.g., *.greenlanecloudsolutions.com). Ensure new tenant deployments are rapid—within seconds of Stripe payment confirmation—automating subdomain setup and tenant provisioning. Build on the existing repo’s structure where possible, enhancing it with these features, and ensure the final app is fully functional, scalable, and ready for production use.
